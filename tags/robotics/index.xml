      <description>Recently I installed ROS on Raspberry Pi2 (both Jessie and Ubuntu 14.04) in order to implement SLAM algorithm on it. However when runs the rviz (rosrun rviz rviz) I get core dumped message.
After searching I found the solution here. What I do is upgrade libpcre3 to 3_8.35 (upgrade collada-dom to 2.4.4 does not help). Here is the download link.
I confirm that rviz now works properly on my Raspberry Pi2 running the official ubuntu 14.</description>

      <description>Course Link: One of the course of Robotics in Coursera from the University of Pennsylvania. It is helpful to learn the classical algorithm of robotics.
Here are some course notes in Chinese collected from Zhihu. These notes introduce algorithm in a little more detail than course.
However, the code in these notes has bug and even can not run normally, which are no worthy of learning. The code in my GitHub pass all homeworks.</description>
