### Introduction

(from Wikipedia)

A **distributed transaction** is a database transaction in which two or more network hosts are involved. 

Usually, hosts provide **transactional resources**, while the **transaction manager** is responsible for creating and managing a global transaction that encompasses all operations against such resources. 

Distributed transactions, as any other transactions, must have all four **ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability)** properties, where atomicity guarantees all-or-nothing outcomes for the unit of work (operations bundle).

distributed transactions = distributed commit + concurrency control

### Solution

1. 2PC (XA、JTA/JTS)
   
    ![2pc](http://7vij5d.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/2pc.png)
    
    Idea:
     - tentative changes, later commit or undo (abort)
     - single entity decides whether to commit —— Transaction Coordinator (TC)

    But it has a bad reputation:

     - slow because of multiple phases / message exchanges
     - locks are held over the prepare/commit exchanges; blocks other transactions
     - TC crash can cause **indefinite blocking**, with locks held
    
    Conclusion:
     - Used in sharded DBs when a transaction uses data on multiple shards 
     - Usually used only in a single small domain
        (E.g. not between banks, not between airlines, not over wide area)

2. 3PC

    Improvement:
    - 3PC is **non-blocking**: it places an upper bound on the amount of time required before a transaction either commits or aborts. This property ensures that if a given transaction is attempting to commit via 3PC and holds some resource locks, it will release the locks after the timeout.

3. MQ (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
    
    Idea: Decoupling, Eventually Consistency, broadcast, flow control, 
    
    Duplicated message, Sequence, Reliability

3. TCC (Try/Confirm/Cancel)
